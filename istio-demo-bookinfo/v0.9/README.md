# Bookinfo

[Bookinfo](https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo/) deploys a sample application composed of four separate microservices used to demonstrate various Istio features. The application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.

The Bookinfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

* productpage. The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.
* details. The details microservice contains book information.
* reviews. The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.
* ratings. The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are 3 versions of the reviews microservice:

* Version v1 doesnâ€™t call the ratings service.
* Version v2 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars.
* Version v3 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.
